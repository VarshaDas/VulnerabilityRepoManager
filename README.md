# VulnerabilityRepoManager

Problem Statement:

Develop an automated solution to compare two YAML files, namely File A and File B, which contain repository information. Each repository entry in both files consists of a repo name as the key and several CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) numbers as the corresponding values. File B is periodically updated with new information.

The goal is to eliminate the need for manual checking and create an automated process to compare the CVE occurrences in File B against the repository information in File A. The solution should handle scenarios where File A contains information for 20 repositories, while File B contains information for 5 repositories.

The automation task involves the following steps:

1. Read the content of File A and File B, which are in YAML format.
2. Iterate through each CVE entry in File B.
3. Check if the CVE exists in File A by comparing it against the repository information.
4. If the CVE is found in File A, proceed to the next CVE.
5. If the CVE is not found in File A, store the CVE information for further processing.
6. Once all the CVEs in File B have been processed, generate a report listing the CVEs that were not found in File A.
7. Print the report or save it to a file for further analysis or action.

By automating this process, the solution will significantly reduce the manual effort required to compare and identify CVE occurrences between the two YAML files.
